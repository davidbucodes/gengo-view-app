# Gengo View

This project is not completed yet and still in development. For example, Kanji data is not updated to the current JLPT exam's structure.

GitHub Pages available for this project (beta version): https://davidbucodes.github.io/gengo-view-app/

This projects tries to increase efficiency when navigating the JLPT learning materials, and when translating words, names or kanjis.

Along with translating via the searchbar, the left menubar enabling access to Japanese kanji and vocabulary relevant for the JLPT levels.

The main concept for the application is that the dictionary data is stored locally, and that queries are searched at a local database, so no network connectivity is required after first load.
